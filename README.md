# Study Hub
I use this repo for storing materials on both theoretical and practical issues. 

Here you can find:

- [Cracking the coding interview highlights (Python specific)](/interview_prep/cracking_the_coding_interview.md)
- [DB and tools - gists/snippets/cheatsheets](/db)

Feel free to use it!
